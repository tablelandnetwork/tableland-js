# Background

Textile's `@textile/tableland` provides zero-config Typescript/JavaScript SDKs that make it easy to user the Tableland network from any Blockchain-based dApp. `@textile/tableland` should feel comfortable to developers already familiat with the [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/) Javascript library. 

Simply import the library, connect your wallet, and you are ready to start making queries to Tables on the Tableland, and minting your own. Interested in supporting additional chains and ecosystems? Create an Issue and let us know!

# Install

```bash
npm i @textile/tableland
```

# Usage


```typescript
import { connect, createTable, runQuery } from '@textile/tableland';

await connect('http://tableland.com'); 

let tableTokenId = createTable("CREATE ..."); 
  
  runQuery("INSERT (firstname) VALUES ('Murray' INTO MyTable)", table.token_id);  
}

```

You can generate a full clean build with `npm build-all` (which uses both `tsc` and `esbuild`).
